    <h2 id="work-history">Work History</h2>
    <div class="work-history">
      <p class="experience">From the very beginning, when I started this job, I held the position of hostess, 
        my responsibilities included
        constant communication with people, creating preliminary menus, and resolving conflicts.</p> 
        
        <p class="experience">Six months later, I was promoted to bartender, where I worked there for about 2 years. 
        I spent most of my time studying, and
        it was more like a part-time job for me. When I was about to graduate from university, I passed a competitive
        selection in several stages to become a restaurant manager, during which my skills of stress resistance,
        responsibility and ability to resolve conflicts and stressful situations quickly and without panic were 
        tested. My main advantage in this competition was my ability to learn quickly. Although from the very
        beginning I did not possess the necessary qualities and skills for adequate work as a manager, but in a 
        short period of a week of internship and training, I was able to assimilate all the information received
        and perform the daily tasks that were required of me. The more responsibilities I was given and the more
        questions I was asked, the more I was able to reveal my skills. I am used to taking on a lot of work 
        that needs to be done, which is why I have developed a habit of multitasking, where I can perform 
        several tasks efficiently, and with more tasks, my work efficiency increases. In this position, I
        improved this skill, and also learned several methods of resolving conflict situations, and also
        learned the basics of accounting, where I was given responsibility for managing the working capital 
        of the institution, here I had to open and close cash shifts every day and keep records of the funds 
        received.</p>
        <p class="experience"> In general, when creating a resume, I don't particularly like to list my advantages, because
        each person has their own strengths, and most communication habits are now well developed in modern 
        society, so I would rather pay attention to my shortcomings, as their number will allow you to choose
        the most rational employee. Here I can honestly highlight a few points for myself, I feel quite 
        confused and sometimes I can be forgetful, but when I am working I quickly get involved and can 
        level these shortcomings. Although I don't have a language barrier, if I don't practice daily, I 
        may gradually lose my communication skills in foreign languages. But I am confident in my 
        communication skills, I can easily find a common language with others, and I have no problems 
        with memory. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.
